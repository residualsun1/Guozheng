I organized fishing nets with Grandpa Feizhen all the morning. It is so smelly that I could't help doubting how fisherfolks could face it everyday.

It occurred to me that many things about the whole life for a fisherfolk. I want to write down something about them while lacking for enough time and energy.

I worked with Grandpa Feizhen until 14:30. What comforted me was that I recorded few thoghts in app *notion*. Hoping that  I could complete the article.

After dinner, I went to Grandpa Feizhen's house and drank a bowl of medicinal wine with him.

It was a pity that I didn't read book tonight--I spent the whole night time in adjusting the appearance of my blog!!

Nevertheless, I want to tell myself: **Reading is a promise, not a whim for me**.
