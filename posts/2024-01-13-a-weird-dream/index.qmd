> "According to pepole in Avila, dreams are the product ot the ambulations of the soul. During sleep, the soul separates from the body, its 'owner', and interacts with the souls of other beings. Dreams are not commentaries to the world; they take palce in it (see also Tedlock 1992)
>
> The vast majority of dreams that are discussed in Avila are about hunting or other forest encounters. Most are interpreted metaphorically and establish a correspondence between domestic and forest realms. For example, if a hunter dreams of killing a domestic pig he will kill a peccary in the forest the following day. The nocturnal encounter is one between two souls--that of the pig and that of the Runa hunter." 

Kohn wrote down these sentences on page 141 of *How forest think*.

I had a really weird dream last night. I dreamed that I wanted to get away from my mother, but when I left her, I missed her so much and I yearn for hugging her.

Coincidentally, just the day before my dream, I was on the phone with my mother. I switched her video call toward me to vocie call, because I didn't want to expose my face to her. I rarely call her and care about her proactively, as I had rejected her at first in the dream world.

But **the absurdity of it** is that I was eager to be back toward her again so badly. From the point of Aliva's view, my soul has encountered the soul of my mother's being. And what I really feel deep down was not leave her, but getting together with her.
