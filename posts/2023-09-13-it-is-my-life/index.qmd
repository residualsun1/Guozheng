![Walking with her on the island. 23 August, 2023](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/residualsun1/en-blog-static/img/2023-09-13-about-her.jpg)

I have traced her silhouettes since I met her in Naozhou island. While she just **frequented** my life, and then left. There once a time when I discerned the feeling I have toward her.

What happened to me? I am...... enchanted? lost? falling in some ambiguous feeling?

I have no idea. Just like a silly man who could not reach **maturity**.

She told me I regard Wang and her to my **desirable** but unattainable standard and phantom.

There is no denying that she has a **fair** precise **grasp** of me. Instead, I was trapped in the fallout of the conduct from her. Like two sides of the same coin, an exolict goal that means some "certainty"(or "determinacy") vanished gradually--whcih refers to downsied. At the same time, it forced me to review my growth progress--

> What do I want to do? Where do I want to go?

Life launched a **philosophy** **invasion** of me. I lost direction--Even thought it is fasle.

Nevertheless, things could not be commplicated. And that is why I write this blog.

When I **recite words** in the early morning, something appear clear. I always doubt myself, but what would confuse us is **eternal** reflection.

Whether I fit it? Whether I like it truly? Whether it is my ~~**sole**~~ own path?

Honey, no answer.

That's the same thing why you should not stay up late.

Something that could inspire us peacefully is important rather than an empty promises of a complex reality.

Obviously, seeking for one thing you could act first and then practice is necessary. Don't expect the result and ending apace and worry about it.

If you find you can enjoy it--A peaceful feeling and you can continue practicing without much push.

Go ahead and keep it.

She has gone to Minzu University of China which is located in Beijing.

From my own point of view, It is the best academic place in China. Nevertheless, I changed me mind--I don't have to be a postgradute. Construct your own story by the mean of various ways.
