I decide to build up my English vocabulary and grammly through reading English original and writing notes for half an hour per day.

This idea was inspired by an [article](https://hongtaoh.com/cn/2021/01/03/how-to-start/) which aims to introduce how to start to do a thing from Hontao Hao. There are three points:

1. Don't begin until everything is ready.
2. The amount could be small, while you have to keep doing everyday.
3. Don't try to be perfect right off the bat. Complete it, develop it, and make it perfect in the end.

The author shared his experiences to explain how we can take conceret actions. He decided to read scholar paper every day from September 2020. The demand he gave to himself was low: Spending half an hour on reading day by day whatever it would happen. If he can't truly accomplish it, he would make up on the second day. 

He managed to to do it, and to my surprise, he has been keeping for [100 days](https://hongtaoh.com/en/apad/). What he gained is that he got better at reading English literature, and got the hang of what is a good structure of a paper and how he should write a paper. 

For me, forming a habit has a higher priority than accomplishing something. That is why I propose a reading plan.
