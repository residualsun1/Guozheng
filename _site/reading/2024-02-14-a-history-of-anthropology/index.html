<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="section">02-14</h2>
<p>Even though a preface in this book also cost my half an hour.</p>
<p>In preface, the author proposed niche of the book:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“This is an ambitious book, but not a <strong>pretentious</strong> ones. <strong>It is ambitious in that it tries, within the space of relatively few pages, to make sense of the diverse history of anthropology</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a little hard to say, while I must admit that what encouraged me to write down above sentence was the seemingly uncomplicated, but actually easily understood meaning. The reason why I recorded it was I would like to get the hang of the framework of the sentence. As what you can see, “……in that it tries, within the space of……, to make sense of……”</p>
<p>The author was prudential<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Our priorities, <strong>omissions</strong> and interpretations are bound to be <strong>contested</strong>, since there can be no single authoritative history of anything, least of all a <strong>sprawling</strong>, dynamic and <strong>disputed</strong> like anthropology. Sill, the book is <strong>unpretentious</strong>, since our aim throughout has been to offer a <strong>sober</strong> and balanced account of the historical growth of anthropology as a discipline, not to propose a <strong>radical</strong> re-interpretation of it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uh, a shameful news: the bolded words are all my unfamiliar<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and unspelled words.</p>
<p>I haven’t read any scholarly literature and textbook on the history of anthropology. According to the author, “The scholarly literature is often specialised, and existing textbooks on anthropological history are either more <strong>theoretically</strong> <strong>oriented</strong> or more committed to one or a few professional traditions.”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Although we may not always have succeeded, we have <strong>strived to</strong> <strong>give an impression</strong> of the <strong>parallel</strong>, <strong>convergent</strong> and <strong>interdependent</strong> developments of all major traditions in social and cultural anthropology.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can we translate above sentence? It seems that Deepl can’t also work.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“尽管我们不一定总能成功，但我们一直在努力让人们了解社会和文化人类学所有主要传统的平行、趋同和相互依存的发展。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Chinese translation is weird.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The book is <strong>chronologically</strong> ordered. Beginning with the ‘proto-anthropology’ from ancient Greece to Enlightenment, it continues with the creation of academic anthropology and the growth of classic sociology during the nineteenth century. The third chapter concentrates on the four men who, by general <strong>consensus</strong>, are considered the founding fathers of twentieth-century anthropology, and the fourth chapter indicates how their work was continued, and diversified, by their students. The fifth and sixth chapters both deal with the same period-from 1946 to about 1968, but concentrate on different trends: Chapter 5 discusses the <strong>theoretical</strong> <strong>controversies</strong> surrounding concepts of society and social integration, while Chapter 6 covers concepts of culture and symbolic meaning. In Chapter 7, the <strong>intellectual</strong> and political <strong>unheavals</strong> of the 1960s and 1970s are presented, with emphasis on the impulses emanating from Marxism and feminism. Chapter 8 deals with the 1980s, concentrating on the postmodernist movement and its close cousin, postcolonialism, two critical trends, which seriously challenged the discipline’s self-confidence; while the ninth and final chapter presents a few of the major post-postmodern trends that emerged during the 1990s”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, we can briefly summarize the timeline.</p>
<p>Nineteenth century(from ancient Greece to Enlightenment):1,2–Twentieth century, four men:3, four men’s students:4, 1946-1968:5,6, 1960s-1970s:7, 1980s:8, 1990s:9,10</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the author didn’t consider the history of anthropology to be a linear tale of progress. The reason is that some ‘modern’ <strong>controversies</strong>, for example, have occupied scholars since the Enlightenment and even earlier. And there has been a steady, cumulative growth in konwledge and understanding within the subject, not least with regard to method. Moreover, “as anthropology responds to changes in the outside world, its substantial focus changes accordingly”.</p>

<section id="section-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="section-1">02-15</h2>
<p>I come back to practice my English through reading and recording anthropological origin again. This is the first chapter, “Proto-Anthropology”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Opinions are divided on this issue.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason why I want to record this sentence is that I would like to use it in my writing.</p>
<p>Some stories concerning some people who are around us or far away from us were written down, nevertheless, they were <strong>criticised</strong> as <strong>inaccurate</strong> or <strong>ethnocentric(or flatly racist)</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“In this broad sense, we start an anthropological <strong>enquiry</strong> the moment a foreigner moves into the neighbouring flat.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the first time I have seen “In this broad sense”, and I always misunderstand the meaning of “enquiry”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“……others again would argue that anthropological research in its present-day sense only <strong>commenced</strong> after the First World War.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“<strong>It is beyond doubt</strong>, however, that anthropology, considered as the science of hunmanity, originated in the region we commonly refer to as ‘the West’, <strong>notably</strong> in four ‘Western’ countries: France, Britain, the USA and Germany. <strong>Historically speaking</strong>, this is the European discipline, and its <strong>practitioners</strong>, like those of all European sciences, <strong>occasionally</strong> like to trace its roots back to the ancient Greeks.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, I always pay attention to adverb in articles. For example, “notably” means especially or most importantly. “occasionally” means sometimes but not often.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“……we today believe that ‘the ancient Greeks’ <strong>differed quite radically</strong> from ourselves.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep, I just want to record “radically” or “quite radically”. “radically” means completely or extremely.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“……free citizens regarded manul labour as <strong>degrading</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“degrading” is an interesting adjective, it means causing people to feel that they have no value.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“……democracy(which was also ‘invented’ by the Greeks) was probably more similar to the the competitive <em>potlatch</em> feasts of the Kwakiutl(Chapter 4), than to the <strong>institutions</strong> described in modern <strong>constitutions</strong>(Finley 1973; P.Anderson 1974).”</p>
<p>“……民主(也是希腊人“发明”的)可能更类似于夸库特尔人(Chapter 4)的竞争性夸富宴，而不是现代宪法中描述的制度(Finley 1973; P.Anderson 1974)。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>okay, I would like to translate it in Chinese, because I can’t still understand its meaning……</p>
</section>
<section id="section-2" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="section-2">02-16</h2>
<p>Encountering a challenge when I click into the next page.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Going back to the Greeks is thus a long journey, and we <strong>peer into</strong> their world through cracked and smoky glass.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Chinese meaning of “peer”, “cracked”, “smoky” and “glass” is strange for me. “peer into” is similar to “stare”.</p>
<p>Okay, the next one is a long and difficult sentence.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“We <strong>catch glimpses of</strong> little city-states surrounded by traditional Iron Age <strong>farmland</strong> where family and <strong>kinship</strong> formed the main social units, connected to the outside world through a network of <strong>maritime</strong> trade relationships between urban settlements along the Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In above sentence, “where” played an important role in my understanding. Deepls translated it as “在那里” in English.</p>
<p>To my shame, I have no idea on an easy sentence because of some words.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The trade in <strong>luxury</strong> goods and the free labour <strong>entailed</strong> by slavery brought considerable wealth to the cities.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Damn it.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“……the citizens of polis, <strong>with their distaste for</strong> manual work, had at their <strong>disposal</strong> a large <strong>surplus</strong>, which they used, among other things, to wage war, and to build temples, stadiums, baths and other public buildings, where male citizens could meet and engage in philosophical <strong>disputes</strong> and speculations about how the world was put togrther.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Herodotus(希罗多德) wrote some detailed travel <strong>narratives</strong>. All right, I just want to record the word “narrative”, its meaning are <u>“a story or description of a series of events”(即中文中的故事或叙述)</u> and <u>“a particular way of explaining or understanding events”(中文中的陈述)</u>.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“In these narratives, <strong>far removed as they are from our present world</strong><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, we recognise a problem that has <strong>pursued</strong> anthropology, in various <strong>guises</strong>, up to this day: how should we relate to ‘the Others’? Are they basically like ourselves, or basically different?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author think Herodotus and most, if not all, anthropological theory has tried to strike a balance between these positions. But Herodotus was sometimes a prejudiced and <strong>ethnocentric</strong> ‘<strong>civilised</strong> man’, who <strong>disdains</strong> everything foreign. However, Herodotus didn’t agree with some statements that different peoples have different values because they <strong>are morally deficient</strong>.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Herodotus’ descriptions of language, dress, political and <strong>judicial</strong> institutions, crafts and economics are highly readable today.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Familiar “institution”, it appeared in the end of <a href="https://residualsun.blog/reading/2024-02-14-a-history-of-anthropology/#section-1">02-15</a>, original sentence is “<em>……democracy(which was also ‘invented’ by the Greeks) was probably more similar to the the competitive potlatch feasts of the Kwakiutl(Chapter 4), than to the institutions described in modern constitutions(Finley 1973; P.Anderson 1974)</em>.” Institution has at least two meanings, one of it is “<u>a custom or tradition that has existed for a long time and is accepted as an important part of a particular society(制度，习俗)</u>”, and the other one is “<u>a large and important organization, such as a university or bank(机构)</u>”. “Constitution” seems have similar structure with it, whcih means “宪法” in Chinese.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Many Greeks tested their <strong>wits</strong> against a philosophical <strong>paradox</strong> that touches directly on the problem of how we should relate to ‘the Others’.”</p>
</blockquote>

<section id="section-3" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="section-3">02-17</h2>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The <strong>Sophists</strong> of <strong>Athens</strong> are sometimes described as the first philosophical relativists in the European tradition(several almost <strong>contemporary</strong> thinkers in Asia, such as Gautama Buddha, Confucius and Lao-Tze, were concerned with similar questions)”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The theme within this chapter is backing to the roots about anthropology, so we can find many words which are in the same theme such as city-states, citizen, sophist, Athens, Persians, Herodotus, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“In Plato’s(427-347 bce) <strong>dialogues</strong> Protagoras and Gorgias, Socrates argues with the Sophists.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can hardly ever understand the next sentence.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“We may picture them in <strong>dignified</strong> <strong>intellectual</strong> battle, surrounded by colourful temples and <strong>solemn</strong> public buildings, with their slaves <strong>scarcely</strong> visible in the shadows between the <strong>columns</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns out that “picture” means “image”, and “dignified” is similar to “solemn”!</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Other citizens stand as <strong>spectators</strong>, while Socrates’ faith in a universal reason, capable of <strong>ascertaining</strong> universal truths, <strong>is confronted by</strong> the relativist view that truth will always vary with experience and what we would today call culture.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a long difficult sentence……</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Plato’s dialogues do not deal directly with cultural differences. But they <strong>bear witness to the fact that</strong> cross-cultural <strong>encounters</strong> were part of everday life in the city-states.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind that “bear witness to the fact that”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Airstotle(384-322 BCE) also <strong>indulged in</strong> <strong>sophisticated</strong> <strong>speculations</strong> about the nature of humanity”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“In anthropology and elsewhere, such a universalistic style of thought, which seeks to establish similarities rather than differences between groups of people, <strong>play a prominent role</strong> to this day. <strong>Furthermore</strong>, it seems clear that anthropology has <strong>vacillated</strong> up through history between a universalistic and a relativistic <strong>stance</strong>, and that central figures in the discipline are also often said to <strong>lean</strong> either towards one position or the other.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From now then on, I can replace “play an important role” with “play a prominent role”. Figures in this sentence means “protagonist”.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Conditions were perhaps particularly favourable for the development of systematic science.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember a concrete useful method from a sentence. Sth. be adj for sth.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“But <strong>in the ensuing</strong> centuries well, ‘civilised’ activities, science and philosophy were <strong>cultivated</strong> all around the Mediterranran.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“in the ensuing” could be used to connect the structure between word and word. “civilised” appear many times, while I still haven’t remembered it. The last word, “cultivate” seems to be similar to “form”/“development”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“……and impressed on <u>its population</u> <u>a culture</u> <strong>deriving</strong> from Greek ideals”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>impress on sb./sth. sb./sth. A fantastic framework.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“In this complex, multinational society, it is not surprising to find that the Greek interest in ‘the Other’ <strong>was also carried on</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What attract me is “be carried on”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Thus, the geographer Strabo(<em>c</em>.63-64BCE-<em>c</em>.CE21) wrote several <strong>voluminous</strong> <strong>tomes</strong> about strange peoples and distant places, which sparkle with curiosity and the joy of discovery.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“voluminous tomes” can be a wonderful together.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Gone were the <strong>affluent</strong> citizens of the cities of <strong>Antiquity</strong>, who could <strong>indulge</strong> in science and philosophy, thanks to their income from trade and slave labour. Gone, indeed, was the entire city culture, the very <strong>glue</strong> that held the Roman Empire together as an(albeit loosely)” integrated state.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can peer into a structure through above sentence——Gone be sth./sb. That can mean something disappeared.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“In its palce, countless local European peoples <strong>manifested</strong> themselves, carriers of Germanic, Slavic, Finno-Ugric and Celtic traditions thar were as ancient as those of pre-urban Greece.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Antiquity is a noun, and ancient is an adjective.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Politically, Europe fell apart into hundreds of <strong>chiefdoms</strong>, cities and <strong>autonomous</strong> local <strong>enclaves</strong>, which were only integrated into large units with the growth of the modern state, from the sixteenth century <strong>onwards</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">

<p>“embryonic” refers to “starting to develop”. “herald” means “to be a sign that something important, and often good, is starting to happen, or to make something publicly known, especially by celebrating or praising it.” To my surprise, “static” means “staying in one place without moving, or not changing for a long time.”</p>
